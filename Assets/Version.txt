Description:
	If the opponent collides with the wall after getting hit by arcana, they will bounce off allowing you to hit another arcana or throw them.
	This shadow/assist is used more for neutral as you can hide behind it and it has bigger projectile priority than the other shadows/assists.
	All characters now have jumping mediums, in general they are slower than jumping lights but do more damage and hitstun.	
	Chip damage is caused when blocking arcana moves, it is always 250 damage. Chip damage cannot kill.
	There is now projectile priority, if your projectile collides with another projectile that has higher priority, your projectile will explode, both projectiles will explode if they have the same priority.
	Added initial replay system, a replay will be saved at the end of a match, you can find the replays under training in the replays menu. Note this is very experimental and a lot of replays can de-sync.
	Buffed parries, they are now frame 1 start up and will push back your opponent, when parrying a parry you get 0.5 arcana, on normal hits its only 0.1 arcana.
	When hitting an opponent middair hitstun wont be removed when grounded meaning that you can continue your combo.
	Fixed command list videos not showing on Web version. Fixed parry framedata not showing. Fixed issues that could happen with some round over conditions.
